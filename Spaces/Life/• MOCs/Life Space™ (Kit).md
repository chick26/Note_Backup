# <-[[Home]] | Life Space™ 
When you add links to folder-based PKM, you need MOCs. It's actually quite simple. For every space you have in your life, you just deploy the MAPS folder structure:

- **M**OCs
- **A**reas
- **P**rojects
- **S**upport notes

## MOCs
MOCs give me a single place go for a given topic.

| I want to...         | ...manage my personal space |
